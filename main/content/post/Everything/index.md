From now on, I will try my best to express my thoughts in English. This is because I have a English competition soom, and I am preparing for it now.

Moreover, I will practice my English more. I have decided to make English my work language.

So, let's talk about today's topic -- Everything.

## Everything

What is Everything? It is a very useful software to search all of the files in your Windows computer at a very fast speed. The first time I use it, I loved it deeply.

Now, the version of this software is 1.5 Alpha. However, its functions are very stable, I have never found a bug during my use.

In the 1.5 version, tow good features are officially supported. The first is Pinyin search (I could ues it via a plug-in in 1.4). The second is Dark mode -- I love it!

These are the reasons I deleted the 1.4 version and now only use 1.5.

## My filter

Everything has a powerful search syntax, and the built-in filters do not meet my needs. So, I wrote my own filter, and I'll share it below (you can ues it).

```text
ext:code-workspace;exe;lnk;zip;7z;rar;png;jpg;jpeg;pdf;doc;docx;xls;xlsx;ppt;pptx;txt;ini;mp3;wav;mp4|folder:<#param:> pinyin:<#param:>
```
