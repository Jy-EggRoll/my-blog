最近在网上查找资料，内容农场真的是越来越严重了。不管查找什么样的内容，结果页总是会跳出和查找目标完全无关的水文章。更严重的是，我发现了 AI 生成的文章越来越多，已经到了令人发指的地步。最令人恶心的是，对 AI 文章追根溯源，竟然是另一篇 AI 生成的文章。

Recently, while searching for information online, I found that content farms have become increasingly severe. No matter what kind of content I search for, the results page always shows irrelevant articles. Even worse, I have noticed that AI-generated articles are becoming more and more prevalent, reaching an appalling level. The most disgusting part is that tracing back the source of AI articles often leads to another AI-generated article.

由衷感叹：搜索引擎（尤其中文）已死。

I sincerely lament: search engines (especially in Chinese) are dead.

我在此立下誓言，本博客将保持产出优质内容的初心，始终以解决真实问题、抒发真实感想为目的。

I hereby vow that this blog will maintain the original intention of producing high-quality content, always aiming to solve real problems and exppress genuine thoughts.

当开学时，更新博客的时间就会变少，但是我会尽可能保持更新的。

When the school starts, the time for updating the blog will decrease, but I will try my best to keep it updated.
